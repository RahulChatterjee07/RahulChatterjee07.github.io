<div style="text-align: justify">As part of my Master‚Äôs project, I designed a Time-Delay Embedded (TDE) Hidden Markov model to detect transient bursts from the beta frequency range (13 - 30 Hz) of MEG signal. In this study, I have used morlet wavelet transform to extract beta oscillatory envelopes from the raw MEG signal. Also, I am currently developing a Machine learning (ML) pipeline to classify MEG/EEG signal into ‚Äôburst‚Äô states in real-time and the results will be further used to design a closed-loop neurofeedback system.</div>

## Network Analysis

### Community Ranking using Social Network Analysis (Sep 2017 - Apr 2018)

[![View on GitHub](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub-View_on_GitHub-blue?logo=GitHub)](https://github.com/RahulChatterjee07/Social-Network-Analysis)

<div style="text-align: justify">In this project, I used the k-clique algorithm to partition the network into communities. The network was formed using Facebook data, collected from survey participants using the Facebook app. The dataset includes node features (profiles), circles, and ego networks. Community ranking was obtained based on the following methods: Method-1: No of social active nodes present in the community. Method-2: On the basis of the value of the function W(m) of nodes present in the community. W(m)=0.5A1(m)+0.5A2(m), where A1(m) is the average number of posts posted per week by user m and A2(m) is the average number of shares plus the number of comments plus the number of likes for each of his posts. </div>
