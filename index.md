## Natural Language Processing (NLP)

### NLP: Tweet Sentiment Analysis with TensorFlow (May - Jun 2018)

I worked on this project during my internship in the Visual Information Processing lab at IIT Kharagpur, India.

**Neural Machine Translation:** An NMT system which translates texts from Spanish to English using a Bidirectional LSTM encoder for the source sentence and a Unidirectional LSTM Decoder with multiplicative attention for the target sentence ([GitHub](https://github.com/chriskhanhtran/CS224n-NLP-Solutions/tree/master/assignments/)).

**Dependency Parsing:** A Neural Transition-Based Dependency Parsing system with one-layer MLP ([GitHub](https://github.com/chriskhanhtran/CS224n-NLP-Assignments/tree/master/assignments/a3)).

### Fake News Detection with Machine Learning (Dec 2021)

In this project, I built a Bidirectional Neural Network and LSTM based deep learning model to detect fake news from a given news corpus.

<div style="text-align: justify">.</div> This project is about emotion state classification of human subjects using single channel EEG data. EEG data from 5 subjects were collected during a horror movie, a comedy movie clip and during a mental task. In this study, I have used different supervised machine learning algorithms (such as KNN, SVM, LDA) and studied their performance (precision, recall and F1 score) in classifying different emotional states.

<div style="text-align: justify"> In this project, I built a Convolutional Neural network-based framework in PyTorch to identify brain stimulation-induced EEG features. EEG data were collected from 30 subjects with 5 different conditions: sham/20Hz/70Hz/individual β/individual γ tACS brain stimulation.</div>
