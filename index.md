### Supervised-learning-based Classification of EEG Signals to Predict Emotional States (May - Jun 2018)

<div style="text-align: justify"> This project is about emotion state classification of human subjects using single channel EEG data. EEG data from 5 subjects were collected during a horror movie, a comedy movie clip and during a mental task. In this study, I have used different supervised machine learning algorithms (such as KNN, SVM, LDA) and studied their performance (precision, recall and F1 score) in classifying different emotional states. .</div>

<div style="text-align: justify"> In this project, I built a Convolutional Neural network-based framework in PyTorch to identify brain stimulation-induced EEG features. EEG data were collected from 30 subjects with 5 different conditions: sham/20Hz/70Hz/individual β/individual γ tACS brain stimulation.

<div style="text-align: justify">As part of my Master’s project, I designed a Time-Delay Embedded (TDE) Hidden Markov model to detect transient bursts from the beta frequency range (13 - 30 Hz) of MEG signal. In this study, I have used morlet wavelet transform to extract beta oscillatory envelopes from the raw MEG signal. Also, I am currently developing a Machine learning (ML) pipeline to classify MEG/EEG signal into ’burst’ states in real-time and the results will be further used to design a closed-loop neurofeedback system.</div>

## Network Analysis

### Community Ranking using Social Network Analysis

<div style="text-align: justify">In this project, I used the k-clique algorithm to partition the network into communities. The network was formed using Facebook data, collected from survey participants using the Facebook app. The dataset includes node features (profiles), circles, and ego networks. Community ranking was obtained based on the following methods: Method-1: No of social active nodes present in the community. Method-2: On the basis the value of the function W(m) of nodes present in the community. W(m)=0.5A1(m)+0.5A2(m), where A1(m) is the average number of posts posted per week by user m and A2(m) is the average number of shares plus the number of comments plus the number of likes for each of his posts. </div>
