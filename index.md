## Natural Language Processing (NLP)

### NLP: Tweet Sentiment Analysis with TensorFlow (May - Jun 2018)

I worked on this project during my internship in the Visual Information Processing lab at IIT Kharagpur, India.

**Neural Machine Translation:** An NMT system which translates texts from Spanish to English using a Bidirectional LSTM encoder for the source sentence and a Unidirectional LSTM Decoder with multiplicative attention for the target sentence ([GitHub](https://github.com/chriskhanhtran/CS224n-NLP-Solutions/tree/master/assignments/)).

**Dependency Parsing:** A Neural Transition-Based Dependency Parsing system with one-layer MLP ([GitHub](https://github.com/chriskhanhtran/CS224n-NLP-Assignments/tree/master/assignments/a3)).

<div style="text-align: justify">.</div> This project is about emotion state classification of human subjects using single channel EEG data. EEG data from 5 subjects were collected during a horror movie, a comedy movie clip and during a mental task. In this study, I have used different supervised machine learning algorithms (such as KNN, SVM, LDA) and studied their performance (precision, recall and F1 score) in classifying different emotional states.

<div style="text-align: justify"> In this project, I built a Convolutional Neural network-based framework in PyTorch to identify brain stimulation-induced EEG features. EEG data were collected from 30 subjects with 5 different conditions: sham/20Hz/70Hz/individual β/individual γ tACS brain stimulation.

<div style="text-align: justify">As part of my Master’s project, I designed a Time-Delay Embedded (TDE) Hidden Markov model to detect transient bursts from the beta frequency range (13 - 30 Hz) of MEG signal. In this study, I have used morlet wavelet transform to extract beta oscillatory envelopes from the raw MEG signal. Also, I am currently developing a Machine learning (ML) pipeline to classify MEG/EEG signal into ’burst’ states in real-time and the results will be further used to design a closed-loop neurofeedback system.</div>
